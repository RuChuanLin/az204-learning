- Know how to interpret metrics from Application Insights.

> **Recommended Hands-On:**  
- Deploy a sample app, enable **Application Insights**, then generate some load or test calls.  
- Check the logs, create an alert for high response times or error rates.

> **Estimated Time:** ~1 week

---

## 7. Integration and Messaging (Week 7)

### 7.1 Event-Driven Architectures
- Azure Event Grid, Service Bus, and Queue Storage.  
- Differences between a **queue** (point-to-point) and a **publish/subscribe** model (Event Grid/Topics).  
- Binding Azure Functions to these triggers (e.g., an Event Grid trigger).

### 7.2 API Management (APIM)
- Basics: Creating an API proxy, managing policies (caching, rate-limiting), developer portal.  
- Might appear in scenario questions about exposing APIs securely.

> **Recommended Hands-On:**

## Extra Tips

1. **Learn by Doing**  
   - The AZ-204 exam is more scenario- and implementation-focused than AZ-900. Spend as much time **hands-on** as possible. Spin up real services, write small proof-of-concept apps, test triggers, etc.

2. **Use Microsoft Learn**  
   - Microsoft provides **free interactive exercises**. These often include sandboxed environments so you don’t incur charges on your subscription.

3. **Join Developer Communities**  
   - Consider joining or lurking in **Azure Developer** communities on Reddit or Discord, or watch Microsoft’s Channel 9 / Azure YouTube content for demos. Real-world Q&As can help clarify tricky concepts.

4. **Focus on Key Tools**  
   - The exam expects you to be comfortable with the **Azure Portal** and potentially the **Azure CLI** or **PowerShell**. Practice them enough so you won’t be confused by command line syntax or UI steps.

5. **Don’t Skip Governance Basics**  
   - While AZ-204 is about development, it sometimes covers aspects of RBAC, cost management, or deployments that cross over into governance. Know enough to handle permissions, tags, or resource locks when relevant.

6. **Check Official Updates**  
   - Microsoft occasionally updates exam objectives. Keep an eye on the official exam page for new skill outlines or added services (especially in the fast-moving Azure landscape).

### Good Luck and Happy Learning!

Following this plan at a **moderate pace (~6–8 weeks)** should set you up for success. If you find yourself progressing faster or slower, adjust accordingly — the goal is to **learn deeply** rather than just memorize. Once you feel comfortable with each domain, schedule your exam (either online or at a test center).

**You’ve got this!** If you have more questions or need clarification on any topic, just let me know. Enjoy the journey to becoming a **Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate**!
