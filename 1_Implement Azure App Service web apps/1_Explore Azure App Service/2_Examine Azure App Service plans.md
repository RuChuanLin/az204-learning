ok, next let me explain azure app service plan,
it is like a resource group that groups a set of app services. It can define the computing resource(VM?), that all app services in the plan can run on it.
A region has to be specify for a plan, which means we assign the logical machine to the plan in a certain region. That is to say, all services on a plan are running on the same region.
Also, we can define the OS, pricing teir, number/size of the VM.
there are several pricing teirs, free and shared compute are Shared tier and can only be scaled up, I assume that this is because they are only allowed to have 1 VM instance at max.
Dedicated computes are basic, standard,  premiumV1 - V3 that people are allowed to have multiple instances so they are able to scale out.
Isolated compute: Isolated V1-V2, provides isolated VNet, that can be isolated to other resources. max in scale out capability.
A plan is a minimal scale unit. When we want to scale out, all resources under a plan will be duplicated and deployed.
Since all the resources are sharing the computing resource in a plan, if a resource is resource-intensive, we should seperate it from that plan.

Great job describing the App Service plan. Here’s a concise summary that ties everything together:

1. **Definition**  
   - An App Service plan is essentially the set of compute resources (VMs) on which your app or multiple apps run.  
   - You choose the region (e.g., East US, West Europe) and configuration (OS, size/number of VMs, pricing tier).

2. **Shared Resources**  
   - All apps under the same App Service plan share the same VM resources (CPU, memory, disk).  
   - If one app is resource-intensive, it can impact the others. You may want a separate plan for apps with heavy or unpredictable workloads.

3. **Pricing Tiers**  
   - **Free/Shared**: Share resources with other Azure customers; limited scale (only scale up, 1 instance).  
   - **Basic, Standard, Premium (V1–V3)**: Dedicated VM resources, allow both scale up/down and scale out/in (multiple instances).  
   - **Isolated (V1–V2)**: Provides network isolation in a private, dedicated environment, with maximum scaling. Great for apps with high compliance or performance requirements.

4. **Scale Operations**  
   - **Scale up/down**: Change your App Service plan tier (e.g., Basic → Standard) or increase VM size (e.g., 1-core → 4-core).  
   - **Scale out/in**: Increase or decrease the number of instances (VMs). All apps in the plan scale together since they share the same pool of VM resources.

5. **Choosing a Plan**  
   - Match your app’s requirements (memory, CPU, scaling behavior) to the right tier.  
   - Group apps with similar performance and scaling needs under the same plan; separate apps that need different resources or strict isolation.

Overall, the **App Service plan** underpins the compute resources of the Azure App Service. It’s the foundational layer that lets you scale, manage, and optimize how your apps consume infrastructure.
