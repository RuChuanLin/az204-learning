could you help compare plan and resource group? here are all I can think of
1. all resources under a plan has to be the same region, actually they are on a since VM instance. It doesn't have to be like that for a resource group, because it is just a logical container.
2. a plan is actually a resource, but a resource group is a container only?

That’s a good start. Here’s a concise breakdown comparing the two:

1. **Purpose**  
   - **Resource Group**: A logical container for managing and organizing Azure resources (like storage accounts, VMs, or App Service plans) that share a common lifecycle or management boundary.  
   - **App Service Plan**: A specific Azure resource that allocates the compute resources (VMs) used by one or more Web Apps, API Apps, or other services in Azure App Service.

2. **Scope**  
   - **Resource Group**: Can contain resources located in different Azure regions – it’s not restricted to a single region. It’s mostly a metadata boundary for organization, deployment, and access control.  
   - **App Service Plan**: Is tied to a specific region and pricing tier. All apps in that plan run in the same region (and on the same underlying VMs).

3. **Function**  
   - **Resource Group**:  
     - Helps manage access (Role-Based Access Control).  
     - Enables you to deploy, update, and delete resources as a set (e.g., using Azure Resource Manager templates).  
     - Doesn’t directly provide any compute or hosting capabilities by itself.  
   - **App Service Plan**:  
     - Determines the compute power (VM size, cores, memory) and scaling behavior (scale up/down and out/in).  
     - Provides the actual hosting environment for your apps.

4. **Cost**  
   - **Resource Group**: There’s no direct charge for a resource group. You’re charged for the resources in the group, but not the group itself.  
   - **App Service Plan**: You pay for the compute resources your plan consumes (except in the free or shared tiers).

5. **Lifecycle**  
   - **Resource Group**: Deleting the resource group will remove all resources in that group (including the App Service Plan, Web Apps, databases, etc., if you don’t move them first).  
   - **App Service Plan**: Deleting the plan only affects that specific compute resource and any apps running on it.

Overall:
- **Resource groups** are organizational boundaries with a lifecycle and access control.  
- **App Service plans** provide the compute layer for your web apps.
