ok, let' talk about authorization and authentication.
app service provides built-in authentication and we can apply the official middleware as a quick way to integrate it to our app.
The middleware runs on the same VM as our application.

**Yes, Azure App Service includes built-in authentication (sometimes called “Easy Auth”) that can offload much of the auth flow from your code**. Here’s the gist:

1. **Integrated Middleware**  
   - When you enable App Service Authentication/Authorization in the Azure Portal, the platform injects a layer (middleware) in front of your application.  
   - This middleware runs in the same App Service worker environment (i.e., the same underlying VM hosting your app) but *before* requests reach your application code.  

2. **Supported Identity Providers**  
   - **Azure Active Directory** (work/school accounts)  
   - **Microsoft** (personal/live accounts)  
   - **Social Providers** like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub  

3. **Flow**  
   - If a request comes in without valid authentication credentials, the middleware intercepts it and redirects the user to the configured identity provider’s login page.  
   - After successful login, it passes an authenticated user principal and claims to your app.

4. **No Code or Minimal Code Changes**  
   - Because the auth is handled by App Service, you don’t need to implement OAuth flows manually.  
   - You can optionally read claims in your application to verify user roles, do custom authorization checks, etc.

5. **Key Benefits**  
   - **Ease of setup**: Turn it on via the Azure Portal or ARM/CLI commands.  
   - **Centralized config**: Manage client ID, client secret, callback URLs from Azure.  
   - **Security**: Offloads sensitive token handling to the platform.

Using this built-in auth is a quick and secure option when you don’t want (or don’t need) to set up a full custom auth pipeline in your code. However, for more complex scenarios, you can still implement your own identity framework using libraries like MSAL, OAuth2, or custom SAML solutions—especially if you need advanced control over the authentication process.

If the oauth is running on the same VM as app, then if there are like 5 VMs in the same time(scale out), how do these VMs understand if a person is logged in or his permissions?
Like I logged in A machine with OAuth, but next time the load balancer assigns me to B machine, how can B machine know who I am

Good question! In most App Service (or any PaaS) scenarios, **authentication is stateless**. Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Token or Cookie-Based Auth**  
   - After a user successfully signs in (via Azure AD or another provider), a **token** (JWT) or an **auth cookie** is returned to the client’s browser.  
   - On *every subsequent request*, the browser automatically includes this token/cookie, which proves who the user is.  
   - Any of the 5 VMs can validate that token/cookie identically.

2. **No “Server Affinity” Required**  
   - Because the token/cookie itself carries the user’s identity (and possibly permissions/claims), it doesn’t matter which VM instance receives the request—any instance can read the claims and know “who” the user is.  
   - This is in contrast to “sticky sessions” or storing session state in a single VM’s memory, which would break if the load balancer directed a user to a different VM.  

3. **How App Service “Easy Auth” Works**  
   - App Service’s built-in authentication (Easy Auth) injects a layer in front of your app. It verifies the token/cookie on each request.  
   - Once verified, the platform populates user information in HTTP headers (like `x-ms-client-principal`), which your app can read. All instances share the same auth configuration, so the validation logic is consistent across all machines.

So effectively, **the user stays logged in across multiple VMs** because each VM sees the same token or cookie and can independently validate it against the same identity provider.
