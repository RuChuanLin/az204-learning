what is the difference between using app service vs initiate a VM and deploy my webapp on it?
As I know, I can use a private VNet that isolates from outside env with a VM, this is a build-in functionality for a VM even when I use the most basic plan. However, I need to use the highest level of plan of the app service so that I can do the same thing?
For a VM resource, I think the machine is dedicated for me? I pay for it even when it is idle, so the most basic plan for a VM is the same tier as premium or isolated teir of a app service?
Also, as a shared tier , when you say "multi-tenant", do you mean that my app is running on the same machine with other Azure/Microsoft account users?

Here’s a breakdown to help compare **Azure App Service** vs. **Azure Virtual Machine**, focusing on networking, isolation, and costs:

---

## 1. Private VNet and Networking

1. **Azure VM**  
   - You can place a VM directly in a private VNet (and subnet) on any tier/size.  
   - You can restrict both inbound and outbound traffic at the network level (using Network Security Groups, firewalls, etc.).  
   - You’re fully in control of OS-level and network-level configurations, but also fully responsible for maintenance, patching, etc.

2. **Azure App Service**  
   - For *outbound* private VNet access (connecting *from* your app *to* resources in a VNet), you can use **VNet integration** starting with **Basic/Standard/Premium** tiers.  
   - For *inbound* private traffic (i.e., accessing the web app *only* from inside your VNet, bypassing a public endpoint), you typically need:  
     - An **App Service Environment (Isolated)** tier, where your entire App Service is deployed in your VNet.  
     - Or a **Private Endpoint** in some premium tiers, which allows inbound private access to your web app.  
   - The **Free/Shared** tiers do *not* support advanced VNet scenarios, so if you need strict isolation or a private IP address, you have to move to higher tiers.

## 2. Dedicated vs. Multi-Tenant

1. **Azure VM**  
   - When you spin up a VM (e.g., a B1 or D2 size), that VM is dedicated to you; no other Azure customer’s workloads run on that specific instance.  
   - You pay for the VM whether it’s heavily used or idle.

2. **App Service**  
   - **Free/Shared Tiers**: *Multi-tenant*. Many customers’ apps share the same underlying servers; your code and data are logically isolated, but physically on the same host. This is why they cost very little or nothing.  
   - **Basic, Standard, Premium** Tiers: *Dedicated compute* (the underlying VMs are allocated only to you), but it is still a PaaS service (Azure manages the OS, updates, etc.).  
   - **Isolated Tier (App Service Environment)**: Dedicated compute *plus* a fully private environment integrated in your VNet. This is the highest level of isolation you can get in Azure App Service.

## 3. Cost and Management Differences

1. **Azure VM**  
   - **You manage it fully**: OS patches, security updates, runtime installation, scaling, etc.  
   - **You pay per VM** (or per VM scale set), so if the VM is idle, you still pay.  
   - You have complete control—essentially Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).

2. **Azure App Service**  
   - **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**: The OS and underlying patches, runtime updates, and scaling automation features are largely handled by Azure.  
   - **Pricing** is per App Service plan tier and instance count. Even if your apps are idle, if you’ve allocated multiple instances in a Standard or Premium plan, you’re paying for them.  
   - Scaling up or out is simpler (a few clicks or CLI commands) because Azure handles the infrastructure behind the scenes.

## 4. Summary Answers to Your Specific Points

1. **“I can use a private VNet with a VM even on the most basic plan, but I need a high tier for App Service to do the same?”**  
   - Correct. A VM can always join a private VNet, right from its creation, regardless of the VM size/tier. For App Service, private inbound access requires either a Private Endpoint (available on Premium) or an App Service Environment (Isolated).

2. **“Is a VM resource dedicated for me?”**  
   - Yes. A VM is dedicated to you (no one else’s code runs on *your* VM). You pay for that VM 24/7.

3. **“Is the most basic VM tier the same as Premium or Isolated for an App Service?”**  
   - They are not *identical*, but the concept is: a single VM is dedicated to you, and so is the compute in a Premium or Isolated App Service plan. However, comparing “Basic VM” vs. “Premium/Isolated App Service” is tricky:  
     - A Basic VM might be cheaper but requires more management effort (patching, backups, etc.).  
     - Premium/Isolated App Service is fully managed PaaS, which typically costs more but removes infrastructure overhead.

4. **“In a Shared tier (App Service), when you say multi-tenant, do you mean my app is on the same machine with other accounts?”**  
   - Yes. Physically, your app processes share the same host(s) with other Azure customers in the Free/Shared tiers—though everything is containerized or sandboxed for logical isolation and security.

### Final Takeaway

- **Use Azure VMs (IaaS)** if you want/need full control over the OS, custom software, or more complex networking from the ground up, and you’re comfortable with the overhead of VM management.  
- **Use Azure App Service (PaaS)** if you want Azure to handle much of the infrastructure management (OS patching, scaling logic, etc.) so you can focus on your application code. For advanced networking (private inbound connections), you’ll need premium or isolated tiers.

Both options can be made private/inaccessible from the public internet, but they differ in how you achieve that and in their cost, management overhead, and feature sets.
