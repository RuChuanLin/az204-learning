## Extra Tips

1. **Learn by Doing**  
   - The AZ-204 exam is more scenario- and implementation-focused than AZ-900. Spend as much time **hands-on** as possible. Spin up real services, write small proof-of-concept apps, test triggers, etc.

2. **Use Microsoft Learn**  
   - Microsoft provides **free interactive exercises**. These often include sandboxed environments so you don’t incur charges on your subscription.

3. **Join Developer Communities**  
   - Consider joining or lurking in **Azure Developer** communities on Reddit or Discord, or watch Microsoft’s Channel 9 / Azure YouTube content for demos. Real-world Q&As can help clarify tricky concepts.

4. **Focus on Key Tools**  
   - The exam expects you to be comfortable with the **Azure Portal** and potentially the **Azure CLI** or **PowerShell**. Practice them enough so you won’t be confused by command line syntax or UI steps.

5. **Don’t Skip Governance Basics**  
   - While AZ-204 is about development, it sometimes covers aspects of RBAC, cost management, or deployments that cross over into governance. Know enough to handle permissions, tags, or resource locks when relevant.

6. **Check Official Updates**  
   - Microsoft occasionally updates exam objectives. Keep an eye on the official exam page for new skill outlines or added services (especially in the fast-moving Azure landscape).
