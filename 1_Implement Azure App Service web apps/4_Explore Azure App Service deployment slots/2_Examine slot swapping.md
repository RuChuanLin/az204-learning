Here’s a concise summary of **App Service Slot Swapping**:

---

## What is Slot Swapping?
- **Definition:** Moving an application from one deployment slot (e.g., staging) into another slot (often production), and vice versa.  
- **Primary Goal:** Achieve near-zero-downtime deployments and easy rollback if there’s an issue.

## How Swapping Works

1. **Pre-Swap Warm-Up**  
   - Before the swap, Azure warms up the target slot so it’s ready to serve traffic. This minimizes downtime when the new version goes live.

2. **Traffic Redirection**  
   - Once warm-up completes, Azure switches the public endpoint (production) to point to what was previously the staging slot.  
   - The old production version moves to the staging slot, allowing quick rollback if needed.

3. **Configuration Swapping**  
   - **Non-“Sticky” Settings** (default): These move with the app during the swap. For example, if staging had certain environment variables, they’ll become the new production settings.  
   - **“Slot Sticky” Settings**: Remain in the original slot. Typically used for production-only secrets or connection strings you don’t want to accidentally move into staging.

## Key Benefits

- **Minimal Downtime Deployments**: Users see virtually no interruption when switching versions.  
- **Safe Testing**: Validate new builds or configurations in a staging slot before exposing them to production traffic.  
- **Quick Rollback**: If a critical issue appears post-swap, you can swap back to the previous version swiftly.  
- **Separate Configuration**: Staging and production can have distinct settings—great for testing different data sources or feature flags.

## Best Practices

- **Warm Up Your App**: Enable **auto swap** or manual pre-swap warm-up to avoid cold starts.  
- **Mark Secrets and Prod-Only Settings as “Slot Sticky.”** This prevents leaking production credentials into test or staging environments.  
- **Test Thoroughly in Staging**: Confirm that everything (performance, logging, dependencies) works before swapping.  
- **Use Monitoring**: Set up alerts or checks immediately after swapping so you catch issues quickly.

### Final Takeaway
App Service Slot Swapping lets you **promote changes from a staging slot to production with virtually no downtime** and gives you a straightforward rollback path if something goes wrong. By carefully managing **slot-specific (sticky) settings** and taking advantage of **warm-up**, you can achieve smooth, reliable deployments.
